 * The direction is used in the rotating callipers method in CollisionSegmentsFinder.
 * For a given pair of callipers, the direction is the relative position of the
 * second calliper to the first.
 * For instance, if the second calliper is to the right (as seen from the counter-clockwise (CCW) view),
 * then the direction is RightDir.

/** \ingroup poxelcollgeometryconvexccwpolygon
 *
 * The collision segments finder finds all the collision segments between two convex polygons in CCW-order.
 *
 * This is done in linear time in the number of points of the polygons.
 * The general method used is rotating callipers.
 *
 * This collision segments finder is part of a robust variation of the algorithm found here:
 * http://www-cgrl.cs.mcgill.ca/~godfried/teaching/cg-projects/97/Plante/CompGeomProject-EPlante/algorithm.html
 * This handles finding all the intersections of the first and second polygon, including but not limited to
 * those intersections that lies in pockets.
 *
 * The collision segments are found in CCW-order, meaning that the segments collisions follow the intersection.
 *
 * Note the definition of a collision segment: for a given index in one of the counter-clockwise (CCW) convex polygons,
 * form a line segment from the current point to the next point, and include all points on the line segment except
 * the current point. Call this the directed line segment. For any given two indices in two polygons,
 * these two indices collide if and only if their directed line segments overlap.
 *
 * ==Status==
 *
 * The current implementation as of 0.1 is meant to be geometrically robust,
 * but gives no guarantees in regards to being numerically robust.
 * The consequences of the lack of numerical robustness is unknown,
 * but may range from imprecision to undefined behaviour.
 * The numerical robustness may be improved in the future.
