  * 
  * This package deals with convex hulls, polygons and polygon intersection.
  *
  * The main data type is the convex, counter-clockwise polygon: ConvexCCWPolygon.
  * This data type covers all possibilities of convex hulls.
  * The concrete types of ConvexCCWPolygon is Empty, Point, Line and Polygon.
  * Different, more constrained intermediate types exists, such as NonemptyConvexCCWPolygon,
  * which only covers Point, Line and Polygon.
  * The different concrete types are meant to improve both the geometric robustness as well
  * as type-safety.
  *
  * The package is meant to have geometric stability, but not necessarily numerical stability.
