/** \ingroup poxelcollgeometryconvexccwpolygon
 *
 * Given a sequence of collision segments between two convex polygons in CCW-order, finds the intersection between the two polygons.
 *
 * This is done in linear time in the number of points of the polygons.
 *
 * This collision segments finder is part of a robust variation of the algorithm found here:
 * http://www-cgrl.cs.mcgill.ca/~godfried/teaching/cg-projects/97/Plante/CompGeomProject-EPlante/algorithm.html
 * This handles merging the previously found intersections of the first and second polygon.
 *
 * If the given sequence is empty, the intersection may be non-empty,
 * for instance if one of the polygons is fully inside the other.
 * To check for that, it is checked whether one of the polygons has
 * a point inside the other, and that polygon is then returned.
 * If no polygon is inside the other, the result is empty.
 *
 * If the given sequence is non-empty, the intersection is non-empty, and it is found
 * by following the collision segments in CCW-order.
 *
 * ==Status==
 *
 * The current implementation as of 0.1 is meant to be geometrically robust,
 * but gives no guarantees in regards to being numerically robust.
 * The consequences of the lack of numerical robustness is unknown,
 * but may range from imprecision to undefined behaviour.
 * The numerical robustness may be improved in the future.
 *
 * @param collisionSegments intersections between the two polygons, given in CCW-order
 * @param poly1Points points of the first convex CCW polygon
 * @param poly2Points points of the second convex CCW polygon
