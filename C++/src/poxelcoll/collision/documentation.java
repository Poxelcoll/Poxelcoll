  * The library supports the narrow phase of collision detection.
  *
  * The narrow phase of collision detection is defined as the parts
  * of collision detection that deals with detecting collisions between
  * two objects. This stands in contrast to the broad phase of collision detection,
  * which seeks to decrease the number of potential collisions between many objects
  * by efficiently filtering out objects that obviously do not collide
  * (ie. small objects that are far away from each other).
  * While this library as of version 0.1 offers no support for broad phase collision
  * detection, there exists other libraries that handles this task,
  * and which potentially can be used with this library.
  *
  * The narrow phase of collision detection generally consists of parts that quickly
  * filter out non-collisions quickly, as well as parts that more precisely and slowly
  * determines whether there is a collision.
  *
  * Two primitives are supported: Convex hulls represented by polygons, and images represented
  * by binary images (useful for pixel-perfect collision detection).
  * For the binary images, the convex hull is used as an (over-)approximation to speed up collision detection,
  * only checking the intersection of the convex hulls of the two colliding objects.
  * Since the convex hull never under-approximates the binary image,
  * it is only necessary to check the intersection of the convex hulls, since
  * anything outside the intersection will never yield a collision.
  *
  * Collision detection are supported between all types of primitives.
  * This means that collision detection for convex hull vs. convex hull, convex hull vs. binary image,
  * and binary image vs. binary image is supported.
  *
  * The standard implementation supports transformation of the two primitives.
  * By 'transformation' is meant translation, rotation and scaling along two axis.
  * This includes the binary images.
  * The transformation for binary images is generally implemented by transforming
  * the convex hull, finding the intersection, creating an image out of the intersection,
  * and back-transforming for each pixel into each object to see if the objects
  * overlap at some pixel. If the convex hulls are precise approximations
  * (ie. the binary image covers at least 95% of the area of the convex hull),
  * this should generally be somewhat efficient.
