  * 
  * The pairwise collision detection handles collisions between 2 independent objects.
  *
  * In general there are 2 main issues to handle for pairwise collision detection,
  * namely precision and performance. Getting high precision and performance
  * simultaneously is generally impossible. For that reason, different
  * implementations that provide different tradeoffs between the two
  * can be provided.
  *
  * '''Current status and improvements'''
  *
  * The status (as of version 0.1) is that 1 pairwise collision detection implementation is supported.
  *
  * The simple pixel-perfect pairwise collision detection implementation
  * supports transformed pixel-perfect collision relatively efficiently.
  * It also handles filled polygons as well, and uses bounding boxes
  * for quick pruning.
  * One issue is that its performance and precision can be adversely
  * affected by scaling.
  *
  * Apart from implementation optimization, this implementation should
  * support most needs. Current issues include numerical instability.
  * The exact effect of numerical instability in the implementation
  * is currently unknown, but future work may address the issue.
  * A potential future implementation could deal with the effect that
  * scaling has on performance and precision, but there are no
  * concrete plans for implementing this, and without any requests or desire
  * for implementing it, it may never be implemented.
