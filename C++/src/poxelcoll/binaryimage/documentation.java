 * The binary image package contains classes to represent
 * binary images, as well as factory methods for them.
 *
 * See BinaryImage for what is understood by a "binary image".
 *
 * The purpose of the binary image package in the library is to have a
 * central, simple and efficient representation of binary images
 * that supports different implementations. This is useful, since binary images
 * can be implemented in several different ways, each with different
 * performance characteristics (eg., a binary image supported by a bitset),
 * and by having one single representation, changing the used binary image
 * and profiling it for performance becomes significantly easier.
