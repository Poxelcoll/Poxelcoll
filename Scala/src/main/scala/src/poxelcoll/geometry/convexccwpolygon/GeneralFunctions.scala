    * A directed line segment is defined as the vector consisting of the points {first, last},
    * where first = poly*Points(i*) and last = poly*Points(next*(i*)),
    * and where * is the number 1 or 2.
    * The first point is not considered part of the directed line segment.
    * Thus, if the directed line segments only overlap in one or two of the first points,
    * there is no collision overall.
    *
    * If there is more than one collision, the overlapping last point(s) are used for the
    * collision point.
