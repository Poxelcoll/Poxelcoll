/** The collision segments finder finds all the collision segments between two convex polygons in CCW-order.
  *
  * This is done in linear time in the number of points of the polygons.
  * The general method used is rotating callipers.
  *
  * This collision segments finder is part of a robust variation of the algorithm found here:
  * http://www-cgrl.cs.mcgill.ca/~godfried/teaching/cg-projects/97/Plante/CompGeomProject-EPlante/algorithm.html
  * This handles finding all the intersections of the first and second polygon, including but not limited to
  * those intersections that lies in pockets.
  *
  * The collision segments are found in CCW-order, meaning that the segments collisions follow the intersection.
  *
  * Note the definition of a collision segment: for a given index in one of the counter-clockwise (CCW) convex polygons,
  * form a line segment from the current point to the next point, and include all points on the line segment except
  * the current point. Call this the directed line segment. For any given two indices in two polygons,
  * these two indices collide if and only if their directed line segments overlap.
  *
  * ==Status==
  *
  * The current implementation as of 0.1 is meant to be geometrically robust,
  * but gives no guarantees in regards to being numerically robust.
  * The consequences of the lack of numerical robustness is unknown,
  * but may range from imprecision to undefined behaviour.
  * The numerical robustness may be improved in the future.
