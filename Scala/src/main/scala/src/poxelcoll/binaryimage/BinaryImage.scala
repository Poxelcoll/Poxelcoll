/** A binary image is a 2D image with non-zero area which only
  * has 2 different values: off and on.
  *
  * It is useful for helping represent collision masks that are not
  * easily or efficiently expressed purely through the use of
  * a convex hull, as well as generating masks directly from existing
  * sprites and images.
  *
  * A binary image is not required to have any on-values,
  * but such an image can not cause any collisions.
  *
  * In regards to the pixels of the binary image, a pixel
  * is understood as a square taking up area exactly one square pixel-unit,
  * with side-length one pixel-unit.
  * The index (x, y) refers to the pixel that takes up space
  * defined by the intervals [x, x+1], [y, y+1].
  * Thus, the pixel at index (0, 0)
  * takes up the area located at [0, 1], [0, 1].
  * This definition is consistent with how pixels in general
  * are drawn and indexed.
