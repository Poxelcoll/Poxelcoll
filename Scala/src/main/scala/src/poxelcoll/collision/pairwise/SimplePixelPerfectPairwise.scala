/** The simple pairwise collision detection takes 2 pairs and determines if they collide.
  *
  * The method takes everything into account, including transformation (rotation, translation, scaling),
  * binary images, filled objects, etc.
  *
  * Strictly over-approximating bounding boxes are used to speed up collision detection
  * by excluding collision objects that do not overlap.
  *
  * '''Method'''
  *
  * The implementation first checks the approximate bounding box found by
  * transforming the bounding box according to the collision objects transformation data,
  * and then finding the axis-aligned bounding box of the transformed bounding box.
  * This is efficient, but not very precise.
  * If they still collide, the detection goes on, else it stops with false.
  * Then the convex hulls of the collision objects is transformed in linear time of the points on the hulls themselves.
  * The intersection of the convex hulls are then found, again in linear time of the points on the hulls themselves.
  *
  * If the intersection is found to be empty, the objects do not collide.
  * Else, all the points that overlaps the intersection is found:
  * Now, for each of these points, the point is transformed back to each of the
  * coordinate systems of the original collision objects, and the binary
  * images of each object is checked. If both are filled, a collision is
  * decided to have occurred, and the algorithm stops with true.
  * If this collision test fails for all points overlapping with the intersection,
  * it is decided that there is no collision.
  *
  * In general, the above method stops as soon as a colliding pixel has been found.
  * Furthermore, if both of the collision objects are filled (ie. they have no binary image),
  * the method stops the moment it has been decided whether or not there is an intersection.
  *
  * This method is generally very performant if the collision objects (including their
  * binary images) are well approximated by their convex hulls.
  * For instance, two triangles that are transformed and scale will generally
  * be checked very quickly, because either their convex hulls will find no
  * intersection quickly (meaning there is no intersection, and thus no need to go on),
  * or else the intersection will consist of on-pixels, and the pixel-perfect detection
  * will stop quickly.
  * Conversely, if collision objects are not well approximated by their convex hulls,
  * collision detection will generally not be so performant, since the convex hulls
  * may have a large intersection where there is few or no on-pixels.
  *
  * '''Pixel-perfect collision detection, precision and scaling'''
  *
  * For the pixel-perfect collision detection,
  * a scaling-invariant method is used. This means that collision detection will generally
  * only be precise and performant as long as the collision objects are not scaled.
  * If the objects are scaled up, they will not loose precision, but they may become less
  * performant. Conversely, if the objects are scaled down, they will loose precision,
  * and may become more performant. The performance and precision of mixed scaling
  * (such as one object scaling up and the other scaling down,
  * or scaling up along one axis and down along the other)
  * is generally difficult to predict, but can be assumed in general to be less
  * performant and precise than if no scaling is present.
